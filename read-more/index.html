  <h1>Title of the Project</h1>
  <p> In recent years, many people have become increasingly aware of the need for physical fitness.* 
  Almost everywhere people turn, whether it is to a newsstand, television or billboard,* advise for guarding and improving health bombards them. 
  Although much of this advice is commercially motivated by those eager to sell vitamins, natural foods and reducing gimmicks,* some of it, especially those advocating a regular exercise program, merits serious attention. 
  Such a program, if it consists of at least 30 minutes three times a week and if a person’s physician approves it,* provides numerous benefits. 
  Regular exercise releases tension, improves appearance, and increases stamina.

The first of these benefits, the release of tension, is immediate.*
  Tension builds in the body because of an over accumulation of adrenaline produced by stress, anxiety, or fear.*
  Doctors agree that performing calisthenics or participating in an active sport such as tennis or volleyball for 30 minutes releases tension.
  If a person swims, jogs, or rides a bicycle for half that time, he or she should sleep better at night and have a better temperament the next day.
  In addition, after the release of tension, petty irritations and frustrations should be less troubling.* For example, an employee upset by the day’s work and by traffic congestion may rush home, argue with the family, and eat excessively. 
  Taking about 30 minutes to release frustration through physical exercise could help the person to avoid this behavior.
  Planned physical exercise, therefore, can eliminate, or at least control, tension.*
